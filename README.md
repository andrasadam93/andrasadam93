### Hi there, I'm Andras, welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹
I am a developer but not sure how to categorize myself. Job-wise, I am a front-end developer, but my education was in mechatronic engineering and then AI. Currently, I am spending a lot of time on developing a PC game and I try to learn as much as possible along the way.

# âš¡ What I kinda know how to do
- JavaScript/TypeScript, ES2020
- Semantic HTML and advanced CSS (preprocessors, animations)
- Major JS frameworks (Angular, AngularJS and a bit of React)
- Major JS libraries (rxjs, lodash, underscore, d3js, etc.)
- C# and Unity
- Data Science and ML/AI basics (Python with numpy, pandas, and also some keras, tensorflow, sk)

I also really believe in true agile working (I am a CSM), I like to pay attention to UI/UX and I love when things are well organized (code, projects, documentation, etc.)


# ðŸ”­ What I am currently working on / learning
- DevOps for front-end development (jenkins, sonarqube, code coverage reports, git-related automation)
- Testing front-end (jest, spectator, cypress, marble diagrams)
- A PC game developed in Unity
- Haskell - to learn something very different

# ðŸŒ± What plans I have
- The PC game to be finished with our team and then we should move on to the next one!
- Reach a state where I can confidently say that I know a *lot* about front-end development
- Learn about tech that is completely different to what I already know to widen my general understanding of programming
