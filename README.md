### Hi there, I'm Andras, welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹
I find great joy in SWE management. As an ex-manager of mine said it is like herding cats. Engineers are like cats: delicate, needy, lazy, clingy creatures that are capable of amazing things when cared for. Having been a cat myself - mostly frontend engineering - I believe I understand some aspects of this cat herder job. The remaining aspects I am constantly trying to figure out.

# âš¡ What I kinda know how to do
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Semantic HTML and advanced CSS (preprocessors, animations)
- WCAG Level AA focus
- Major JS frameworks (Angular, React, bit of Vue)
- Major Angular-related libraries (rxjs, ngrx/akita, lodash, underscore, d3js, etc.)
- C# and Unity for game develpoment
- Data Science and ML/AI basics (Python with numpy, pandas, and also some keras, tensorflow, sk)

I also actually believe in true agile processes (I am a CSM), I like to pay attention to UI/UX and I love when things are well organized (code, projects, documentation)

# ðŸ”­ What I am currently working on / learning
- Infrastructure, DevOps (with cloud in mind)
- Building truly sustainable SWE organizations
- Catching up on the theoretical leadership skills that I thought I have intrinsically
- Home automation project for the family weekend house

# ðŸŒ± What plans I have
- Pick up my PC game development project once again
- Actually get better at the home automation stuff hardware-wise as well
- Continue my growth in leadership
