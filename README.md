### Hi there, I'm Andras, welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹
I am a developer but not sure how to categorize myself. Job-wise, I am a front-end developer, but my education was in mechatronic engineering and then AI. Currently, I am spending a lot of time on developing a PC game and I try to learn as much as possible along the way.

# âš¡ What I kinda know how to do
- JavaScript, ES6, Typescript
- Major JS frameworks (Angular, AngularJS and React)
- Major JS libraries (MomentJS*, rxjs, lodash, underscore, jQuery, d3js, etc.)
- C# and Unity
- Machine Learning basics (Python with numpy, pandas, keras, tensorflow, sk)

Also I really do believe in agile working (I am a CSM), I like to pay attention to UI/UX and I love when things are well organized (code, projects, documentation, etc.)

*it is now being discontinued :(

# ðŸ”­ What I am currently working on / learning
- DevOps for front-end development (jenkins, sonarqube, code coverage reports, git-related automation)
- Testing front-end (jest, spectator, cypress, marble diagrams)
- A PC game developed in Unity

# ðŸŒ± What plans I have
- The PC game has to be finished with our team and then we should move on to the next one!
- Deepen my front-end knowledge to be an all-around front-end dev
